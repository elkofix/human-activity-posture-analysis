## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a real-time human activity and posture analysis system capable of recognizing key movements such as walking, turning, sitting, and standing. Using computer vision and pose estimation techniques (via MediaPipe), the system tracks human joints to analyze posture, joint angles, and lateral inclinations. The project aims to provide an intelligent tool for movement annotation and classification, useful in areas such as health monitoring, sports performance, and ergonomic assessment. By combining data collection, annotation, and supervised learning models, the system seeks to improve accuracy in detecting human activities in diverse real-world conditions.

## Getting Started
Instructions for contributors
1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how contributors may obtain the data )*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
